# 🌐 LCD message translation

The only component, that needs some sort of translation, is the LCD module, since it is interacting with the end user.
How it works: all files, located in `hardware/display/i18n/translations` and have a prefix of `active.(lang)` will be
treated as translation files. The desired language should be specified in the `settings` file. If the translation for
the language does not exist, English will be the default.

All contribution to language translations are welcome! We're using [go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) for
internationalization, so follow the instructions there to translate a new language. The translated file should be added
to `hardware/display/i18n/translations` folder.
