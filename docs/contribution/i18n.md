# 🌐 Display message translation

All files, located in `internal/chargepoint/components/hardware/display/i18n/translations` and have a prefix
of `active.<lang>` will be treated as translation files. The desired language should be specified in the `settings`
file. If the selected language is not supported, English will be set as a default.

All contributions are welcome! We're using [go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) for internationalization, so
follow the instructions in their repository to create a new translation. The translated file
should be added to `internal/chargepoint/components/hardware/display/i18n/translations` folder.
