# PN532

## Description

The PN532 reader can communicate through UART/I2C/SPI. The client uses the NFC go library, which is a wrapper for libnfc
1.8.0 (and above). You could use any other libnfc compatible NFC/RFID reader, but the configuration steps as well as
wiring could vary.

## Wiring

The pinout will also vary depending on your preferred communication protocol. This pinout is used for UART.
