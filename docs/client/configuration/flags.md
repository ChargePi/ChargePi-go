Environment variables are created automatically thanks to [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) and are prefixed
with `CHARGEPI`. Only the settings file attributes are bound to the env variables as well as debug mode and API
settings. Connectors do not have their attributes bound to environment variables.

Example environment variable: `CHARGEPI_CHARGEPOINT_CONNECTIONSETTINGS_ID`.
