# 🛠️ Configuration

There are three **required** configuration files:

1. [`settings`](../../configs/settings.json)
2. [`configuration`](../../configs/configuration.json)
3. [`connector`](../../configs/connectors/connector-1.json)

The settings files are supported in `YAML`, `JSON` or `TOML` format. All files must be only in one format. The format is
configurable though program flags.

## The `settings` file

The `settings` file contains basic information about the charge point and provide connectivity details:

- Charge Point ID,
- central system URI and OCPP protocol version,
- OCPP information (vendor, model, firmware, etc.),
- logging settings,
- TLS settings,
- default max charging time,
- hardware settings for LCD, RFID/NFC reader and LEDs.

The table represents attributes, their values and descriptions that require more attention and might not be
self-explanatory. Some attributes can have multiple possible values, if any are empty, they will be treated as disabled
or might not work properly.

|        Attribute        |                                  Description                                  |                         Possible values                          |

|   hardware: minPower    | Minimum power draw needed to continue charging, if Power meter is configured. |                            Default:20                            |

## 🔌 The `connector` file(s) - EVSEs and connectors

EVSE and connector settings file scan be found in the `connectors` folder. To add and configure the connector, simply
add a new file that contains the structure, defined in [attributes](#attributes) and modify it to your specs. The client
will scan the folder at boot and configure the connectors from the files if all the settings have valid values.

Note: A Charge point can have multiple EVSEs, each oh which can have multiple connectors, but only one connector of the
EVSE can charge at a time.

### Attributes

`Connector` object contains a connector type and an ID of the connector, which must start with 1 and increment by one.
The status attribute changes according to the OCPP specification. The `session` represents a Charging session and is
used to restore the connector's last state when starting the client.

The `relay` and `powerMeter` objects are configurable to specific GPIO pins and SPI bus. The `inverseLogic` attribute in
the relay object indicates the logic of the relay. If `inverseLogic` is set to _true_, the relay will use negative
logic. The `powerMeter` also contains some attributes for measurement calibration.

The table represents attributes, their values and descriptions that require more attention and might not be
self-explanatory. Some attributes can have multiple possible values, if any are empty, they will be treated as disabled
or might not work properly.

|     powerMeter: shuntOffset      | Value of the shunt resistor used in the build to measure power.  |                 Default: 0.01                  |
