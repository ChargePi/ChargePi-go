# âš¡ Charge point with Mender

We will use [Mender](https://mender.io/) as OTA service for updating Linux, Docker and the client. For the OCPP
server/central system, we will use **[SteVe](https://github.com/RWTH-i5-IDSG/steve)**.

1. Sign up on Mender. If you want, host a Mender server yourself.
2. Follow this guide
   for [installing Mender on the Pi](https://docs.mender.io/get-started/preparation/prepare-a-raspberry-pi-device).
3. Add the Raspberry to the Devices list and test if Mender works.
4. Clone the SteVe repository to ChargePi/. It should automatically create steve folder.
   > *Skip this step if you do not want the server to be hosted on the same machine. Mostly used for testing purposes.*
5. If you do not wish to automatically update the OCPP client, change this label to false in **docker-compose.yaml**:

```yaml
   #Not recommended when using Mender, since you can update the images with Mender.
   chargepi:
     label:
       - com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable="false"
       #...
```

6. Run docker-compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

Optionally, you can run only the client service:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d chargepi
  ```
