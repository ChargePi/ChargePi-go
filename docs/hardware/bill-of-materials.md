# üìù Bill of materials

## ‚ùó Note:

The bill of materials can vary, depending on your preferences, part availability and price. The aim of the project is to
make a charging point out of off-the-shelf hardware that is widely available. Also, the list is not in any way perfect.

The list might not be suitable, if you're trying to make a charging point for EVs. In this case, you will need a proper
EV Charging controller and safety components.
